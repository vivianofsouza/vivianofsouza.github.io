                After a day and a half of travelling, I am finally in Ireland!
                It was an uncommonly sunny and dry day, so the view as the plane
                was landing was spectacular! The pictures do not do the country
                enough justice; Ireland is truly very green! After collecting my
                bags and passing through customs, I boarded the bus that would
                take us to the campus. The ride was about 45 minutes and we got
                to see some of the surrounding areas near Limerick.
              </p>

              <p>
                Finally, at about 7 pm I reached Thomond Village, my home for
                the next 5 months. When I walked into the kitchen, I met four of
                my roommates who immediately asked me where I was from.
                Apparently, they had made a bet on where the next roommate would
                be coming from and some had correctly guessed that I would be an
                American! My roommates are Volkan, Yoann, Olivia, Maxence (who
                are all from France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· ), Cyrus (from Hong Kong ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡°), and Marie
                (from Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª). They are all very nice and funny and I enjoy
                hearing about life in their different countries. We have many
                laughs together!! ðŸ˜‚
              </p>

              <p>
                For our first dinner, we all ate spaghetti and salad, as all of
                the restaurants and shops were closed. This is a surprise to me,
                as in the US many stores are open 7 days a week, and are open
                until 11 pm. It was quite funny to see my French roommates
                cutting up and eating their spaghetti with a knife and fork! I
                had never seen anyone eat spaghetti like this but I must say it
                is very mannerly. My roommates also always say "have a good
                meal" or "enjoy your meal" before anyone eats. This really isn't
                a thing in the US so I was quite surprised that they always say
                this, but I also think it's very polite.
              </p>

              <p>
                Another great thing about living with other international
                students is that we all speak different languages. Since four of
                my roommates are French, there's a lot of French spoken in our
                apartment. I have even learnt some basic phrases in French (Je
                m'appelle Vivian. Je suis une americaine. J'habite en Caroline
                du Sud), although now I regret not taking French in high school!
                My roommates also often ask me to read over emails or
                assignments in English for them. Doing this really forces me to
                think about language and how to explain grammar rules I don't
                really think about. From this, I can see how many consider
                English a very difficult language!
              </p>

              <p>
                My roommates often tell me that they find the Irish accent hard
                to understand. I understand most Irish people well, but there
                are a few where even I struggle to process their speech. There's
                a girl in one of my classes who talks so fast that it takes me
                at least a minute to understand and respond. I hope she doesn't
                think I'm dumb or something. It's just that in America we talk
                way slower.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the next couple of days, we did a bit of exploring on campus
                and attended orientation modules. I was really impressed at how
                modern the campus looks but also about how much natural beauty
                there is. I love getting to cross the Shannon River everyday on
                my way to classes. We also learnt how to ride the bus system and
                went on a walking tour of the city and a trip to the mall. To
                me, Limerick is unlike any place I've seen before! It is both
                small and big at the same time; and also modern and old at the
                same time too. I love the Riverwalk area and how King John's
                Castle is sitting there admist all of the much newer buildings
                in the city. Although it is quite cold, it is very enjoyable to
                walk around in the city and just get lost in it. Coming from a
                place that is more sprawled out and requires a car to get
                around, I appreciate the walkability of Limerick.
              </p>

              <p>
                Cyrus and I also tried out the Irish McDonald's. While the food
                was ok, we both agreed that it was quite expensive compared to
                back home. Things in Ireland tend to be a bit more expensive,
                with the exception of dairy and meat (which taste way better
                here). I also have to mind the conversion between the dollar and
                the euro.
              </p>

              <p>
                Another thing I'll have to get used to are the small fees
                everywhere. From stuff like paying 20c for the toilet to paying
                5â‚¬ for a sticker to get into the on campus pub, I feel like I'm
                bleeding money everywhere. In the US, we have a lot of free
                amenities, such as free public bathrooms in every store and free
                refills in restaurants. When it comes to events held on my
                college campus, everything is free (which probably means we pay
                for it in our much higher tuitions). What I mean to say is that
                at least such amenities are free at no extra cost or they are
                paid upfront instead of in hidden fees.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are many things to do regarding signing up for classes.
                Unfortunately, I learnt that the classes I had selected before
                coming here would not all fit into my schedule. Unlike at an
                American university, there is only ever one section of a class
                happening here at UL. Because two of my courses were held at the
                same time, I had to drop one of them. In the end, I ended up
                taking Data Structures and Algorithms, Introduction to Web
                Development, Performance Technology, and Irish Traditional Music
                and Dance.

                All in all, there is much more to write about, especially about
                my travels in Ireland, so see you in the next post!
