            <p class="lead">Touring Ireland's Natural Wonders</p>

            <p>
              This weekend we took our first sightseeing trip in Ireland. We
              went to see one of Ireland's most famous natural wonders: the
              Cliffs of Moher. We had to wake up quite early at 7 am to prepare
              and catch our bus at 8 am. I sat next to Marie on the bus and we
              talked a lot about the weather and landscapes in our respective
              countries.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Cliffs are located on the coast of County Clare, about an
              hour's drive to the northwest from Limerick. We first stopped at
              Lahinch Beach, which is at the foot of the cliffs. I felt a bit of
              nostalgia for Charleston's beaches but one thing that they do not
              share in common with an Irish beach is good weather. It was
              freezing and so so so windy!! I felt that I was about to fly
              away!! And I couldn't believe my eyes, but I saw some people
              dipping their feet into the ocean and even surfing üò≤
            </p>

            <p>
              There were lots of rocks along the beach, which we climbed to get
              a better view of it all. However, the tide was coming in, so we
              often had to scramble precariously across the rocks. I think it's
              safe to say that this beach is a better place for pictures than it
              is for relaxation.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our bus then took us to the Cliffs of Moher Walk, where we once
              again braved the strong winds to admire the beautiful cliffs. They
              are truly a work of natural art! Especially when the sun came out,
              one could see how deep the blue of the water was and how bright
              the green grass could be. It was also nice to just gaze out at the
              Atlantic and get lost for a while. As my roommate Yoann put it,
              "from here, the next stop is America". As someone who has been on
              both sides of the Atlantic, I can confidently say that the view is
              terrific from both üòÅ
            </p>

            <p>
              While Marie and I were walking back to the bus, we passed an Irish
              boy who just happened to burp super loud. It was such a big noise
              that I had thought a seagull was nearby. We both burst out into
              laughter and the guy just laughed it off and said "Cheers" ü§£
            </p>

            <p>
              Next, we visited the Burren. The Burren is a karst, a kind of
              landform that is made up when rocks like limestone are dissolved.
              Apparently, farmers used to let their cattle graze across the
              Burren. It kinda felt like we were standing on the surface of the
              Moon. Finally, we visited Poulnabrone dolmen. This is an ancient
              tomb that dates back to between 3800 to 3200 BC.
            </p>

            <p>
              I've realized that the landscapes of Ireland remind me a lot of
              where I used to live in Kentucky. The green grass, limestone,
              rolling hills, and freshwater everywhere are very characteristic
              of both places. I'd say Kentucky has a lot more mountains than
              Ireland though.
            </p>

            <p>
              Also, I have received my schedule (see below). At most, I have
              three classes on Thursday and just two on Mondays, Wednesdays, and
              Fridays:
