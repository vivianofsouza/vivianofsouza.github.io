                <p>
                  This week, we went to Blarney Castle and Cork City. Blarney
                  Castle is famous for its Blarney Stone. Legend has it that if
                  you can kiss it you'll be granted the gift of eloquence. There
                  are many castles in Ireland and this is one of the most
                  famous.
                </p>

                <p>
                  When we got there, we walked through the visitor's center and
                  the gardens. As we approached the entrance of the castle, we
                  saw two pillories, places where criminals would have to sit as
                  punishment with their heads and arms out. When we went into
                  the castle, one of the first things that we saw was a trap
                  door. If someone pulled a lever, the person standing on the
                  door would fall into this really deep hole and be imprisoned
                  there.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Then, we explored the inside of the castle. Most of the castle
                  was accessible by very narrow staircases that had only a tiny
                  rope to hang on as a railing. I'm not usually scared of
                  heights, but I was a bit afraid of missing a step and falling
                  onto the throng of people behind me.
                </p>

                <p>
                  When we reached the top floors, we saw the rooms for the
                  kitchen, the kids' bedroom, and quarters of the Lord and Lady
                  of the house. We even wandered into the bathroom of the
                  castle! Thankfully no bad odors from centuries ago could be
                  smelled.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Finally, we ended up in the Great Hall where the castle's
                  inhabitants would have held banquets and dances. Here we also
                  got to kiss the Blarney Stone. To kiss the stone, you have to
                  lay on your back with the guide holding you, while you slide
                  back and crane your neck to reach the stone. Since I am on the
                  short side, I was too scared to go all the way down, so I just
                  touched the wall instead.
                </p>

                <p>
                  After touring the castle, we went to the Poison Garden.
                  Everything in this garden is poisonous, so we could only look
                  but not touch the plants. We then stood on the walls of the
                  castle and caught the view of the river and countryside
                  beyond.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Around lunchtime, we took the bus into Cork. We only got to
                  spend 2 hours there so we made the most of it by visiting the
                  English Market. The English Market is a very big farmer's and
                  artisan market. There are so many things you can buy, such as
                  fresh seafood, meats, cheeses, breads, and other foods like
                  jams and teas. I bought a bag of Pistachio Truffle tea from a
                  shop as a souvenir for my mom since she loves drinking tea. I
                  also bought a nice-looking raspberry cheesecake from a bakery
                  stall. I hope to come back to the market again because they
                  were so many stalls and I want to buy some more things for my
                  family and friends back at home.
                </p>

                <p>
                  On our way back to the bus we wandered around and took in the
                  sights of the city. Cork is the second-largest city in
                  Ireland, and it definitely felt much bigger than Limerick. We
                  did not spend enough time here and I would like to come back
                  sometime soon!
