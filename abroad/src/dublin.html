            <p class="lead">Ireland's Largest City</p>

                  My roommates and I took the 8 am bus to Dublin. It took about
                  two hours to get to the city. When we arrived, I was quite
                  surprised because it looked quite small for a capital city.
                  But when we got off, I realized it was quite big. It was
                  definitely bigger than Charleston. Like most major Irish
                  cities, Dublin is built along the river, the River Liffey.
                  There are many bridges crossing the river, which splits the
                  city into two.
                </p>

                <p>
                  On our way through the city center, our bus driver pointed out
                  some famous monuments and statues and explained the history
                  behind them. A lot of the events and people surrounding the
                  Irish struggle against the British were centered in Dublin. On
                  my next trip back, I will be sure to visit some of these
                  historic places.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The bus let us down at the Spire of Dublin, which can be seen
                  from anywhere in the city. From there, we took a city bus to
                  St James Gate, also known as the entrance to the Guinness
                  Storehouse and Museum. Once inside, we got to see how the
                  black stuff is really made. We learned about where and how
                  some of the basic ingredients come from and are used. We also
                  learnt about the history of the company itself from its
                  founding in 1759 by Arthur Guinness to its present-day status
                  as a symbol for Ireland worldwide. We then got to see some
                  cool Guinness advertisements and memorabilia.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Then it was time for some taste-testing! We were led into a
                  room where there were four barrels from which the scents of
                  the four main ingredients of the beer wafted out. After we had
                  had our fill of the smells, we got to sample a small glass of
                  Guinness. Slaint√©!
                </p>

                <p>
                  Finally, we went up to the Gravity Bar, where we received our
                  free pint of Guinness and got some amazing views of Dublin!
                </p>

                <p>
                  The next stop was the Old Library at Trinity College Dublin. I
                  loved the entrance to the campus, and I was immediately
                  envious of the students that go to school here. Darla Moore
                  and Swearingen back at USC cannot compare to this!
                </p>

                <p>
                  Inside, we saw exhibits explaining the history of the Book of
                  Kells and the process through which it was created. It amazes
                  me how people could make something so grand and intricate
                  without the use of modern technologies. This is especially
                  true of the intricate illustrations on the pages. It must have
                  taken lots of time and patience to pull it off. We got to take
                  a look at a folio and it was so beautiful!
                </p>

                <p>
                  Then we went into the Long Room, the most famous part of the
                  library. It literally was just out of a movie! I spent so much
                  time just taking pictures and admiring the books and shelves.
                  At the end of every shelf stood a bust of a famous author,
                  both from Ireland and from around the world.
                </p>

                <p>
                  There were also photographs of famous Irish photographers and
                  the original document of the Proclamation of the Irish state.
                  In the center, one could see the Brian Boru harp, a harp
                  dating to the 1100s that is the base for the Irish national
                  symbol.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In the gift shop, I purchased two key rings for my parents.
                  They were of figures from the Book of Kells. I just love the
                  colors and I hope my parents will too!
                </p>
